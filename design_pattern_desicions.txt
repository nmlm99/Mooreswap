In my EthSwap DApp I used functional programming principles that are at the core of design patterns in React. In functional programming Functions are representations of mathematical functions, which means:

The returned value is always the same when given the same arguments (i.e. it doesnâ€™t depend on local or external state - the only thing taken into consideration are the arguments themselves)
It causes no side-effects (it never changes any internal or external state)

I also used Object Oriented Programming because class components inherit from Component or PureComponent. Object-oriented programming ris a type of computer programming in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
